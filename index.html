    <p>
      I really enjoy making jewelry as a past-time because it's a very fun and
      cuztomizable hobby. I start by drawing a sketch of what I vision and then
      choose the correct beads to bring my vision to life!

    <ul>
      <li>Ducks can live up to 20 years in the wild.</li>
      <li>Ducks have amazing vision.</li>
      <li>Ducks are very social animals.</li>
    </ul>

      I love watching movies and finding out about different timelines as well
      analyzing plots of different styled movies. I like watching movies at home
      but watching new movies in the theatres will always be superior.
